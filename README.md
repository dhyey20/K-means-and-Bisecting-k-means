# K-means-and-Bisecting-k-means

This Netbeans project contains k-means and bisecting k-means java implementation for a 2d data. The user
can feed in the k-value in k-means and the program outputs the cluster centers of all k-clusters and also
the cluster label for each data point. In bisecting k-means, the program itself generates optimum number
of clusters and returns the center of each cluster and the cluster labels of each point.
